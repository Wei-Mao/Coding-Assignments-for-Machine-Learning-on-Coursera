# Programming Assignments for Machine Learning offered by Coursera                                         
This project is exactly the programming exercises counting towards the sucess of Machine Learning offered by       Coursera.
The algorithms are implemented with Octave (A GNU version of Matlab)
## Programming Exercise 1
This assignment covers the Linear Regression with one variable and multivarites. The optimization methods involve both gradient descent and normal equation. Importantly, implementation adopts the vectorized version!
